# Tag

!! This is a program I wrote and abandoned a long time ago. I'm working on resurrecting it, but the current codebase can be considered an archeological excavation. There will be some usage of deprecated APIs, poor code quality, and hardcoded constants for a while.

See [https://tightloop.io/resurrection/index.html](https://tightloop.io/resurrection/index.html) for more information
